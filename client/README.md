# Brainstorm Application

### About
* This text-based application is designed to help you brainstorm your ideas!

### Overview of Code
* The basic idea behind this React.js application is to send information through the API routes every time the "Enter" button is pressed.
* We update the state for all the text that is input through a brainstorm and arrays of concepts, ideas, and steps.  
* We also set up keys for the current concept and current idea in order to update the headers of the following cards and send this data to the database as parent IDs of a given input.

### How to Use
* Type in your Brainstorm topic and press "Enter".
* Once the new line appears under it, type in your first Concept and press "Enter".
* Type in as many Concepts as you like, and once you are ready to come up with Ideas, you can repeat the same process in the following Ideas card.
* Your Ideas will be saved under your Concept, and you will see the given Ideas per Concept once you click on any given Concept.
* Once you have come up with all your Ideas, you can further elaborate on the third card, aka the Steps Card.
* Repeat the same process with the Steps Card as you did with the Ideas Card.
* Be sure to press "Enter" every time you are finished typing!
